                <p>About FuelFinder!</p>
                <p>Fuel finder is a simple application for locating which filling stations have fuel to sell. This is done via crowd-sourcing. Users like you enter the particulars of filling stations that sell fuel around them. This helps others to locate these same stations so they don't have to go around town looking for fuel.
